# Generalized Linear Models - Multinomial Regression

## Overview

This project contains a brief introdution to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with emphasis on Multinomial Regression and contains the sample execution in R.

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a class of statistical models that extend linear regression to handle a broader range of response variable distributions such as binomial, Poisson, and gamma, making them suitable for diverse types of data. Unlike traditional linear regression, GLMs are not constrained by the assumption of normality.

Multinomial Regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature with a multinomial distribution and has more than 2 levels (categories).
